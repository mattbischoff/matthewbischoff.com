I’m a nerd about a lot of things: pens, musicals, cocktails, iOS apps, the list goes on. These are subjects that I have read a lot about, developed my own opinions on and tastes in, and gotten good at in some form or fashion over years of practice. It’s fun to be nerdy about stuff; especially when you can use that knowledge to share your appreciation with other people, build community, and brighten up the world a little.

But for all the things I _am_ nerdy about, there are so many more things that I’m just not. There simply isn’t time to be a nerd about everything, and even if there was, I just can’t and won’t care about everything to the same degree. **And that’s a good thing**. 

The troubling thing I’ve noticed is that people tend to get stuck in their little comfortable nerd bubbles and forget that there's so much to explore outside of the things they’re already super into. They decide they like superhero movies and never watch a drama, or that they’re a Windows user for life and never give Linux a shot. Sure, people like what they like. But for me, being open to new things has led to some of my best experiences.

If I go to a bar and they don’t serve craft cocktails, but they have an impressive wine cellar, I won’t be disappointed. Quite the opposite, I’ll be elated. The opportunity to let a sommelier (i.e., professional wine nerd) teach me something and open my up ability to appreciate the craft of winemaking is one I wouldn't have had if I just ordered a martini, which I already knew I’d love.

Of course, this comes up in programming circles constantly. Engineers get so stuck in the technology we already know, whether it be Swift, React, Ruby, or otherwise, that we forget that great ideas exist in so many places and other languages may have already solved the problem we’re having more elegantly. We forget to let other developers and practitioners teach us. We forget to let ourselves *not* know things.

There are geeks everywhere, geeking out on almost every topic. Once in a while, make the effort to find one who’s writing or speaking on a topic you know nothing about, and just listen to them. Watch a video from a conference you’d never attend, attend a talk about a style of art you’ve never appreciated, try a new cuisine. Even if you still dislike it, you might learn something. Who knows, you may love it so much you decide to get nerdy about it too.
