## The process of progress

![underconstruction2.gif](/uploads/underconstruction2.gif)

What if something was designed one day, one change at a time? What if every day, it got just a tiny bit better? Revealed more of itself?

This project explores the ideas of [continuous improvement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen), [impermanance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi), and [gradual transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_transition).

It’s inspired by Web 1.0’s [Under Construction GIFs](http://textfiles.com/underconstruction/), [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org), [Thing a Week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing_a_Week), [Song a Day](https://songaday.world), [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), [HRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy), the [IndieWeb movement](https://indieweb.org), and the [CSS Zen Garden](https://csszengarden.com).

## Process

1. Start with the minimal markup and styles needed.
2. Make *one* small change to the styles every day.
3. Change markup, structure, and rules whenever.

## Progress

Each change will be documented here with a time-stamped commit and screenshot.

**2024-04-01**: Launch this project.
