## a process of progress

What if a website was designed one day, one rule at a time? What if every morning, a website got just a tiny bit better? Revealed more of itself.

This project explores the ideas of continuous improvement or kaizen ([改善](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)), incompatibility, and modest changes.

It’s inspired by Thing a Week, Atomic Habits, and the CSS Zen Garden.

## How it Works

1. I’ll make *one* small change to the stylesheet of this website every day.
2. The structure and markup of the site may change alongside it.
3. These rules are subject to change.

## Changelog

Each change I make will be documented here and with a time-stamped commit and screenshot.
