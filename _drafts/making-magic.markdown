  alt: The album art for Making Magic. An illustration of a Hitachi Magic Wand, an
    electric personal massager, floating in a vibrant blue and pink sky with clouds.
    The cord of the massager is coiled around, with sparkles and stars scattered around.
    The words “Making Magic” are prominently displayed at the bottom in bold pink
    and white letters.
