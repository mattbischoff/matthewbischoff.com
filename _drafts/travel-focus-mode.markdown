Last summer, I visited Toronto to see my wife after being separated by pandemic-related border closures for months. I decided to use that trip as an excuse to test out the new iOS 15 Focus Mode feature.

Here‚Äôs how it works. I set up a [special focus mode](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1429069655629500416) called **Travel** that I manually switch into, or that automatically activates when I launch a flight tracking app or visit an airport in New York. When I‚Äôm in this mode, a few things happen all at once: my home screen switches to a (normally hidden) page that displays widgets for apps I always find myself searching for when I‚Äôm on a journey, my watch face changes via a Shortcuts automation to a special travel watch face, and my notifications are silenced except forthe people and apps that I‚Äôm expecting to interact with while traveling.

I found that this tiny automation made the somewhat stressful process of international air travel just a little bit smoother, and I‚Äôm looking forward to using it again when I fly to see her in March ü§û. So, in the interest of sharing, here are my settings in case you want to use them to build your own travel focus mode.

## The Travel Focus Mode

*Set this up in Settings ‚Üí Focus.*

  <dd>Messages from friends, family, Find My, Kindle, Flighty, App in The Air, Uber. I also allow any time-sensitive notifications.</dd>
  <dt>Focus Status</dt>
  <dd>Off. I don‚Äôt need to telegraph to the whole world that I‚Äôm traveling, because I‚Äôll still check hidden notifications, just less frequently.</dd>

  <dd>Enable the custom tavel page and disable all other pages.</dd>
