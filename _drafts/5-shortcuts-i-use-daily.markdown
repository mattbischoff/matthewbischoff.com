This Friday I spent an hour and a half chatting with
Matthew Cassinelli about how I use Apple’s Shortcuts app to simplify my work and life. We went through 13 of my 156 custom-built shortcuts, showing both how they work and how they’re built, and answered questions from the chat. As promised on the stream, here are 5 of those shortcuts that I use every day, with links to download and a brief explanation of why they save me so much time.

## File a Radar

As a power user of Apple software and developer of apps for their platform, I have a lot of, shall we say, feedback. Every time I run into a paper cut or an API I wish existed, I run this shortcut to file a new feedback (née radar) with the mothership and pray it gets addressed years from now in an OS update.
