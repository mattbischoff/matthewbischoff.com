Last summer, I visited Toronto to see my wife after being separated by pandemic-related border closures for months. I decided to use that trip as an excuse to test out the new iOS 15 Focus Mode feature.

Hereâ€™s how it works. I set up a [special focus mode](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1429069655629500416) called **Travel** that I manually switch into, or that automatically activates when I launch a flight tracking app or visit an airport in New York. When Iâ€™m in this mode, a few things happen all at once: my home screen switches to a (normally hidden) page that displays widgets for apps I always find myself searching for when Iâ€™m on a journey, my watch face changes via a Shortcuts automation to a special travel watch face, and my notifications are silenced except forthe people and apps that Iâ€™m expecting to interact with while traveling.

I found that this tiny automation made the somewhat stressful process of international air travel just a little bit smoother, and Iâ€™m looking forward to using it again when I fly to see her in March ðŸ¤ž. So, in the interest of sharing, here are my settings in case you want to use them to build your own travel focus mode.
