Last summer, I visited Toronto to see my wife after being separated by pandemic-related border closures for months. I decided to use that trip as an excuse to test out the new iOS 15 Focus Mode feature.

Here’s how it works. I set up a [special focus mode](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1429069655629500416) called **Travel** that I manually switch into, or that automatically activates when I launch a flight tracking app or visit an airport in New York. When I’m in this mode, a few things happen all at once: my home screen switches to a (normally hidden) page that displays widgets for apps I always find myself searching for when I’m on a journey, my watch face changes via a Shortcuts automation to a special travel watch face, and my notifications are silenced except forthe people and apps that I’m expecting to interact with while traveling.

I found that this tiny automation made the somewhat stressful process of international air travel just a little bit smoother, and I’m looking forward to using it again when I fly to see her again soon 🤞. So, in the interest of sharing, here are my settings in case you want to use them to build your own travel focus mode.

### Travel Focus Mode
*[Set this up in Settings → Focus](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608).*

🔴 **Allowed Notifications**: Messages from friends, family, Find My, Kindle, Flighty, App in The Air, Uber. I also allow any time-sensitive notifications  
⛔️ **Focus Status**: Off. I don’t need to telegraph to the whole world that I’m traveling, because I’ll still check hidden notifications, just less frequently  
📱 **Home Screen**: Enable the custom tavel page and disable all other pages   
📍 **Name & Appearance**: I use a purple map pin icon, because I wasn’t using purple for anything else, and there’s no airplane icon available  

### Travel Home Screen
*[Create and hide this home screen](https://support.apple.com/en-me/HT211345) by tapping on the page dots on your home screen while in editing mode.*

From top to button, I include widgets that display:

✈️ **[Flighty](https://www.flightyapp.com)**: My gate, check-in, departure, and arrival time  
🧳 **Find My**: The location of my suitcase (via an AirTag), so I know when it’s getting close to me on the arrival side if I’ve checked it  
📒 **Notes**: A permanant note called “Travel Documents” that always contains my boarding pass screenshot, COVID test, and anything else I may need to board  
🌨 **Weather**: The current conditions in my destination city  
⏰ **Clock**: The current time at my destination, espcailly useful if changing time zones  
🔋 **Batteries**: Reminds me when I need to charge my devices, or where I need to conserve power while waiting through long delays  

### Apple Watch Face
*Set this up in the Apple Watch app or on your watch, then use Shortcuts automation to change to it when the Travel is on.*

The watch displays the things I need to be able to glance at the most frequently while in lines or moving around the airport. I use the Infograph Modular face to pack a lot of info onscreen at once.

🌎 **Earth**: Mostly just looks cool and reminds me I’m in the travel mode  
✈️ **App in the Air**: Flighty doesn’t have a watch app, so I continue to use App in the Air to check my gate / boarding time from my wrist  
💬 **Messages**: It’s handy to have one tap way to message Kate that I’m delayed or arriving!  
🧳 **Find My Items**: Another way to get to info about where my suitcase is  
🌥 **Weather**: Gotta know whether to take that jacket out of my backpack or not when I arrive

Hopefully when you’re able to travel safely again, a travel focus mode will make your trek less of a headache.
