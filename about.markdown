**mb bischoff**{:.full-name} <small>([they/them](https://pronouns.org/they-them)) <abbr title="Formerly Known As">f.k.a.</abbr> Matthew Bischoff</small> is a designer & developer in New York City. They are a founder and partner at [Lickability](https://lickability.com), a software studio known for its [apps](https://lickability.com/products) and work for [clients](https://lickability.com/clients) like The Atlantic, Houseparty, and Meetup.

mb began blogging and podcasting in 2003 and got their start in tech as IT Director of [PodcastPeople](https://www.podcastpeople.com/) at age 13. After high school, they studied human-computer interaction at the [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu/), before [dropping out](https://matthewbischoff.com/don-t-go-to-college/) to join the mobile team at [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/). They worked at [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) during its heyday, as an engineer, engineering manager, and product manager.

All the while, mb and their business partners were working to grow Lickability from a side project into the [ten-person team](https://lickability.com/about) it is today. In 2015, mb went full-time at the company, and since then, they’ve worn multiple hats as a product manager, software engineer, sales lead, and token extrovert.

mb is an acclaimed speaker, giving [talks](https://matthewbischoff.com/category/talks/) at conferences around the globe focused on the intersections of technology and culture. They write about these and other topics [here](https://matthewbischoff.com) and on the [company blog](https://lickability.com/blog/).

In their spare time, mb enjoys crafting  classic cocktails, seeing live theatre, and trawling Wikipedia for interesting facts. They’re proudly bisexual, trans, & nonbinary. Oh yeah, and [they were on Jeopardy!](https://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=3342)
