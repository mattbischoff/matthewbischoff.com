## a process of progress

![underconstruction2.gif](/uploads/underconstruction2.gif)

What if a website was designed one day, one rule at a time? What if every morning, a website got just a tiny bit better? Revealed more of itself?

This project explores the ideas of continuous improvement ([kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)), [software’s incompleteness](https://media.defense.gov/2019/May/01/2002126690/-1/-1/0/SWAP%20EXECUTIVE%20SUMMARY.PDF), and [fresh starts & modest changes](http://www.43folders.com/topics/fresh-starts-modest-changes).

It’s inspired by Web 1.0’s [Under Construction GIFs](http://textfiles.com/underconstruction/), [Thing a Week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing_a_Week), [Song a Day](https://songaday.world), [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), the [IndieWeb movement](https://indieweb.org), and the [CSS Zen Garden](https://csszengarden.com).

## The Process

1. Start with the bare minimum markup and styles needed to be functional and legible.
2. Make *one* small change to the stylesheet every day.
3. Change the markup, structure, and rules along the way.

## Changelog

Each change I make will be documented here and with a time-stamped commit and screenshot.
