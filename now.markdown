This *[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)* is [inspired by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). It covers the things I’m thinking, feeling, and working on, well, *right now*.

## Life 👱🏻

I’m living in New York City (recently renewed my lease actually), and I’m fully vaccinated, though still being cautious because of the Delta variant. 🩹

My wife, [Kate Sloan](https://twitter.com/Girly_Juice) and I have been separated by the U.S./Canada border since April. I miss her lots, but I’m excited because I get to see here agin in a few weeks! ✈️

I’ve been hanging out with friends and family IRL again and it’s absolutely wonderful. A few weeks ago I even met a stranger in a bar and spent the night learning about them. Wild! If you’re in or around NYC and wanna meet up and hang out, [let's do it](https://matthewbischoff.com/lets-hang-out/)! 👋

For fun I've been singing [musical theatre tunes over on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@matthew_bischoff/) and I’m practicing [card magic](https://danielroymagic.com/cardmagic101) again. I’ll show you a trick sometime. 🃏

### Feelings 🔮

[I turned 30](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJaNlzXJMy0/) in December, and it's made me think a lot about how I spend my time and what impact I want to have on the people around me. More to come on that once I have more time to think about it. 

There's *so* much we need to do in order achieve the massive political change this country needs. Right now I’m advocating for and donating to causes like [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com), [trans rights](https://transequality.org), [abortion access](https://abortionfunds.org), and [prison abolition](http://criticalresistance.org).

### Gender 🏳️‍⚧️

I [came out as nonbinary](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1150437952155242496) two years ago. I’ve tried a bunch of new clothes, shoes, and makeup recently, and they’re helping me see myself as I am. I'm also beginning to explore medical transition options, and I'm excited I'll be able to have an “X” on my [license](https://www.syracuse.com/state/2020/11/new-york-to-add-nonbinary-gender-option-x-for-drivers-licenses.html) and [passport](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2021/07/01/passport-have-new-gender-option-added-non-binary-people/7826603002/) soon.

Being correctly gendered feels great, while being misgendered continues to suck, especially when it’s from people who know me well, like friends or family.

### 2021 Theme: Invest 📈

Based on [The Theme System](https://www.thethemesystem.com), which I learned about through the [Cortex](http://cortex.fm) podcast, I choose a yearly theme. [This year’s theme](https://matthewbischoff.com/2021-theme-invest/) is **Invest** which means this year I aim to:

* Spend time, attention, and money on things with long-term potential. 🕰
* Build systems, relationships, and habits to last. 🏛
* Evaluate bets consistently and adjust. ⚖️

## Work 👅

My job as a Partner at [Lickability](https://lickability.com) involves leading the team, setting product direction, helping with day-to-day operations, and talking to new and existing clients about what we can do for them.

At the moment, I’m [hiring an engineer](https://jobs.lickability.com), shutting down our office, and leading a few client projects.

### Talks 🗣

Last year I gave my first remote talk, *[Apps for All: Making Accessible Software](https://matthewbischoff.com/apps-for-all/)* at [App Builders CH](https://appbuilders.ch). If you enjoyed it and you’d like me to speak at your event in 2021, [get in touch](/contact).

### Podcasts 🎙

I love listening to (and [guesting on](/about/#podcasts)) podcasts, and being hone alone has allowed me to catch up on my huge backlog. Some shows I’m binging lately: [Gender Reveal](https://www.genderpodcast.com), [Do By Friday](http://dobyfriday.com), [Question Box](https://www.questionboxshow.com), [The Dildorks](http://thedildorks.com), and [You’re Wrong About](https://yourewrongabout.com).

If you’d like me to have me on your podcast, I’ve got all the time in the world at the moment and would really love that. [Shoot me an email](mailto:mb@matthewbischoff.com?subject=Podcast), and let’s do it.

### Music 🎶

Here’s a playlist of the albums that I’m listening to in heavy rotation.
