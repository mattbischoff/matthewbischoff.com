You don’t have to be the everything guy. In fact you can’t be and that’s okay.

I’m a nerd about a lot of things: pens, musicals, cocktails, iOS applications, the list goes on. These are subjects that I have read deeply on, developed my own opinions and taste on, and gotten good at in some form or fashion over years of practice. It’s fun to be nerdy about things; especially when they’re things you can appreciate with other people, find community around, and brighten up little corners of the world with.

But for all the things I _am_ nerdy about, there are so many more things that I’m just not. There simply isn’t time to be a nerd about everything, and even if there was, I just don’t care about everything to that degree. And that’s a good thing. 

The troubling thing I’ve noticed in recent years is that people tend to get stuck in their little nerd cubbyholes and forget that there's so much to explore outside of the things they’re already great at. If I go to bar and they don’t serve excellent craft cocktails, but they have an impressive wine cellar, I won’t be disappointed. Quite the opposite, I’ll be elated. The opportunity to let the sommelier (aka professional wine nerd) teach me something and open my up ability to appreciate the craft of winemaking is one I wouldn't have had if I just ordered a Mai Tai, which I already know I love.

This comes up in programming circles constantly. We get so stuck in the technology we already know, whether that be Swift, React, Ruby, or otherwise, that we forget that great ideas exist in so many places. We forget to let other developers and practitioners teach us. We forget to let ourselves *not* know things.

There are geeks everywhere, geeking out on almost every topic. Once in a while, make the effort to find one who’s writing or speaking on a topic you know nothing about, and just…listen. You might learn something, and who knows you may even decide to get nerdy about their thing too. Wouldn’t that be swell.
