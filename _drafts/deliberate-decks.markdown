Powerpoint presentations get a bad reputation. That’s because most of them are terrible. They’re boring, they’re too long, and they’re full of tiny text and crammed with awkward animations. On the other end of the spectrum, there are the rare over-produced Keynotes from companies like Apple that have been agonized over by legions of designers to sell you on their latest technology. These seem impossible for mere mortals to put together.

So it’s no wonder that in my jobs on small to medium size software teams, I don’t see many slide decks. And the ones I do see often come from professional hypesters trying to sell their startup and elicit cringes from the software engineers and designers in the room (or the Zoom as the case may be). But earlier in my career as a builder, I used decks to great effect. And I miss them. In 2022, I’ve decided I’m bringing back the deck. Deck Back Better, I say!

When my longtime friend and collaborator Brian Capps and I worked as iOS engineers and leads at The New York Times, we noticed something interesting. There were a lot of intractable technical problems in the organization that seemed unsolvable due to politics and inter-team communication roadblocks. As people who cared deeply about the quality of the products we were building, we were searching for any way to get product managers, designers, and business folks all on the same page about what we wanted to fix in the iOS app. And believe it or not, the best tool we found (after testing many) was the slide deck. Here’s what we did when we really wanted something to get fixed: 

Brian and I would book a conference room together in the middle of the day, write an outline of what we wanted, and then develop a simple and well-designed slide presentation to make our argument. By the way, we never told our bosses we were doing this. Then, we’d presell the idea by showing the deck on our laptop to just a few people we know would be key decision-makers and solicit their feedback, editing the deck as we heard their objections. Finally, we’d book a meeting with everyone in the organization who would need to be on board if we were going to make the change. 

For example, once we wanted to make sure that all advertisements in the NYTimes iOS app were rendered at the proper resolution for retina iPhones. We knew we’d need a designer, the head of digital ad sales, an ad trafficker, a product manager, and an engineering lead. So we booked all of those folks into a meeting called "Retina Ads", dimmed the lights, and presented our hearts out. This worked so well, we did it again and again and improved the app numerous times this way. Our little slideshow sideshow routine got so popular that it earned us the nickname: *The Twins*.

Presentations like this work because the form is literally made for it. Slides make information digestible, they show that you’ve thought deeply about the problem and the effort they take to make shows that you’re serious and that you care. Anyone can write an email, post a Slack message, throw together an email, or toss a meeting on the books. But few people will take the time to put together a deck.

The next time you’re trying to convince a group of folks at work who all have different priorities that the team should do something you really want, give this a shot: pop open your slideshow-making tool of choice and make your argument in 40-point type, one slide at a time. I bet your slides will change more minds than you suspect.
