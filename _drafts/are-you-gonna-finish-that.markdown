title: Are You Gonna Finish That?

I’m a completionist by nature. When I find a new blog, podcast, or webcomic series I love, my curiosity pulls me toward consuming its backlog, often all of it. I spend hours spelunking the archives, sucking the bones of my media discovery dry. I’m overly familiar with the siren’s song of the summit.
Growing up, I attended Catholic school and was taught by nuns to finish my food because there were children starving halfway across the world. I was taught to finish one book before starting the next. Taught to give equal attention to every station of the cross.

Perseverance can be a useful tool in one’s toolbelt. There are moments in life that call for grit and for pushing through discomfort and disinterest. But fetishizing finishing isn’t nearly as helpful as it seems on the surface. Just the act of having completed something isn’t virtuous by itself. Context matters here.

We are living in a time of ceaseless information overload. By way of example, more than 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. And our time and attention are limited resources. In this context, a more useful skill is knowing when to finish something and when to abandon it.
Personally, I’ve gotten better at this over the years. I’ve become more attuned to what my body and brain are telling me about the value of the thing I’m doing to my future self. Some questions I ask myself when deciding whether to bail or stick with it:
* Am I enjoying it?
* Will it make me a better person?
* Will it help me accomplish something or solve a problem?
* Will it matter in 5 years? 10?
* Is there something I’d rather do?
* Have I had enough?
* Would it be better to set it down now and pick it up again later?
* Is it feeding my mind or my heart?
* What’s the worst thing that would happen if I stop now?

These questions are designed to give you permission to quit the thing that you’re trying to finish if it’s not serving you anymore. Maybe it’s a New Year’s resolution you regret making, a book that all your heroes recommended but you keep bouncing off of, or even a friendship or relationship that doesn’t fit you any more but that you keep maintaining out of a sense of duty.

You don’t have to finish everything. Quitting doesn’t make you a quitter. It makes you someone that knows their worth. Stopping give you space to start something that serves you better. And if you make a mistake, that old thing will probably still be there if you want to come back to it.
