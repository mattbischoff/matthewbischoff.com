My 2021 [yearly theme](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1345050751643619335) is **Invest** 📈.

* Spend time, attention, and money on things with long-term potential. 🕰
* Build systems, relationships, and habits to last. 🏛
* Evaluate bets consistently and adjust. ⚖️

[Last year’s theme](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1212389093650419713) was about making commitments. Getting married was one of them, but so was writing more consistently on my site. This year builds on those commitments with a focus on things with longer timelines.

If you’re curious about the idea of yearly themes, here’s the [latest Cortex episode](https://relay.fm/cortex/110) on the topic.
